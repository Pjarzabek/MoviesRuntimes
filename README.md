# Are new movies longer than they were 10, 20, 50 year ago?

**If you like to watch movies and I mean _a lot_ of movies, there is a chance that you noticed that movies are getting longer and longer nowadays. When was the last time you went to the cinema and watched blockbuster which was shorter than 120 minutes? More and more movies (thank you Marvel for encouraging this trend!) have also scenes after subtitles, so you wait patiently all the way till the end, even if your bladder is killing you for some time already.**

__These are the times when you could think “Gosh, movies are getting ridiculously long lately”. Are they? I asked myself the same question. I discussed the matter with some fellow movie lovers. They had similar feelings. That wasn’t enough for me. I decided to use my data analysis skills to investigate this issue. In this article you can read what I have found out.__

Final study is available in [Jupyter notebook]( https://github.com/Pjarzabek/MoviesRuntimes/blob/master/Are%20the%20movies%20getting%20longer.ipynb). You should read it if you want check what I’ve found. 

Two Python scripts to review my code are available here: 
+ [movies_data.py]( https://github.com/Pjarzabek/MoviesRuntimes/blob/master/movies_data.py) – in this script the dataset was created and saved to csv.
+ [movies.py]( https://github.com/Pjarzabek/MoviesRuntimes/blob/master/movies.py) – this script contains analysis done with Pandas and Matplotlib libraries.
